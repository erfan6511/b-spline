# Controlling the minimal feature sizes in adjoint optimization of nanophotonic devices using b-spline surfaces(code)
This  repository  contains the MATLAB and python codes for our paper (Khoram, Erfan, et al. "Controlling the Minimal Feature Sizes in Adjoint Optimization of Nanophotonic Devices Using B-spline Surfaces." arXiv preprint arXiv:1907.06548 (2019).). The MATLAB code uses many parts of the MaxwellFDFD package (W. Shin, MaxwellFDFD Webpage, 2015. https://github.com/wsshin/maxwellfdfd) for the electromagnetic field simulations; while the python code uses a modified version of the FDFD solver in the Angler package available at "https://github.com/fancompute/angler" created for Hughes, et al.'s work, ("Adjoint method and inverse design for nonlinear nanophotonic devices." ACS Photonics 5.12 (2018): 4781-4787.) for the electromagnetic simulations.

# Controlling the Minimal Feature Sizes in Adjoint Optimization of Nanophotonic Devices Using B-spline Surfaces
This  repository  contains the MATLAB and python codes for the our paper "Controlling the Minimal Feature Sizes in Adjoint Optimization of Nanophotonic Devices Using B-spline Surfaces". The MATLAB code uses many parts of the MaxwellFDFD package (W. Shin, MaxwellFDFD Webpage, 2015. https://github.com/wsshin/maxwellfdfd) for the electromagnetic field simulations; while the python code uses a modified version of the FDFD solver in the Angler package available at "https://github.com/fancompute/angler" created for Hughes, Tyler W., et al.'s work, ("Adjoint method and inverse design for nonlinear nanophotonic devices." ACS Photonics 5.12 (2018): 4781-4787.) for its simulations.
